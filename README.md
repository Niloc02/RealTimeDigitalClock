# Realtime Digital Clock
This project consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to create a simple real-time digital clock. The clock displays hours, minutes, and seconds in a dynamic and visually appealing manner.

## Description
The digital clock is designed using HTML, styled with CSS, and made functional with JavaScript. It features three separate sections for hours, minutes, and seconds, each with two segments displaying the digits. The time updates in real-time and gives a seamless transition effect when the digits change.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aarzoo75/Realtime-Digital-Clock.git
```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage
The clock is straightforward to use. When you open the `index.html` file in your web browser, the clock will start displaying the current time. The hours, minutes, and seconds segments will update in real-time to reflect the accurate time.
